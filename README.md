# Credit-card-fraud-detection
In this project, I have used various classifiers like logistic regression, decision tree,
random forest and naive bayes to detect whether a transaction is a normal payment or 
a fraud. Since the data is highly imbalanced, we check the performance of imbalanced dataset 
first and then we implement techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN to balance the dataset 
and again check the performance of balanced dataset. Finally, we compare the 
performances of each model and conclude that the final model is random forest 
classifier using ADASYN method which achieves an F1 score of 84.9 % on the test data.
